# Final-Project-2022 
Cricket App --- [Jira Board Link](https://jphilopowell.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DFP/boards/2)
--------------

## Why have I done this project?
The purpose of this project was to demostrate the skills I have been building over the course of the QA DfE Software Bootcamp, which ran from November 2021 to Feburary 2022. This project brings together skills I have learnt in Java, MySQL, SpringBoot, Jira, to create a fully functional API with CRUD functionality. During this project I used a Jira board (link above) to plan my time effectively, and a risk assessment to identify and prepare myself for any problems that may occur. For the project I created a cricket bat storage system using the Spring Boot framework to build a java app, that can access a local MySQL database and a h2 database, while using postman to send requests to my API.

--------------

## How did I expect the challenge to go?
At the start I expected this project to be reasonably challenging, as we had only just recently learnt many of the these methods, so there has been a lot of information consumed over a short period of time. However I had also built up a reasonable collection of notes and example projects to help me with this project.

--------------

## What went well / what didn't go as planned?
I feel that the project has overall gone quite well, and I was able to use methods that I had learnt on this course, and apply them to something of interest to me, which has helped me further understand them. It has been useful in repeating methods over, as this has increased my confidence with methods I have learnt. Some methods however did prove to be a little more tricky than others, including using the feature branch method on Git, as this was something that I had been taught but hadn't actually used before, so I was a little rusty to start.

--------------

## Any improvements for the future?
My overall goal of this project was to make sure that I met the projects MVP, so I think if i was to further work on this project, or do it again in future I would like to extend on it by looking at completing more of the stretch goals. For example I think it would be helpful to have a ERD diagram, and potentially include some custom queries, for example "Find by make" and "Find by year" as this would make my application more useful.
